## Integration with Your App

### API Layer Integration
```javascript
// Dashboard data
const dashboardData = await db.query('SELECT * FROM view_monthly_business_dashboard');

// Member portfolio
const memberPortfolio = await db.query(
  'SELECT * FROM view_member_portfolio_summary WHERE members_id = $1', 
  [memberId]
);

// Risk analysis
const overdueLoans = await db.query(`
  SELECT * FROM view_loan_overdue_analysis 
  WHERE overdue_bucket <> 'CURRENT' 
  ORDER BY overdue_days DESC
`);
```

### Report Generation
```sql
-- Monthly portfolio report
SELECT 
    product_type,
    total_accounts,
    total_active_balance,
    avg_active_balance
FROM view_product_performance_summary;

-- Member growth report
SELECT 
    period,
    new_members,
    retention_30_day_pct,
    retention_90_day_pct
FROM view_member_growth_analysis
ORDER BY period DESC;
```

### Automated Alerts
```sql
-- High-risk loans alert
SELECT COUNT(*) as high_risk_loans
FROM view_loan_overdue_analysis 
WHERE risk_category IN ('DOUBTFUL', 'LOSS');

-- Portfolio health alert
SELECT portfolio_health_status
FROM view_financial_health_indicators;
```

## Performance Considerations

### View Dependencies
Some views depend on others:
- `view_loan_overdue_analysis` ‚Üê used by `view_financial_health_indicators`
- `view_sub_account_balance` ‚Üê used by many other views
- `view_member_portfolio_summary` ‚Üê used by member analysis views

### Refresh Strategies
For better performance with large datasets:
```sql
-- Create materialized views for heavy queries
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_monthly_business_dashboard AS
SELECT * FROM view_monthly_business_dashboard;

-- Refresh periodically
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_monthly_business_dashboard;
```

### Indexing Recommendations
The views assume these indexes exist:
```sql
-- Already created in view files
CREATE INDEX idx_transaction_details_account_sub ON transaction_details(accounts_id, sub_accounts_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_members_status ON members(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_loan_accounts_status_members ON loan_accounts(status, members_id);
-- ... and more
```

## Customization

### Account-Specific Filters
Many views filter by account IDs. Update these to match your setup:
```sql
-- In view_members_bal, change account ID as needed
WHERE td.accounts_id = 3 -- Update this

-- In view_rd_trans, update RD account ID
WHERE td.accounts_id = 76 -- Update this
```

### Business Rules
Modify business rules in views to match your policies:
```sql
-- In view_loan_eligible_members
WHEN COALESCE(savings.total_balance, 0) >= 500 THEN 'Y'  -- Adjust minimum savings

-- In view_loan_overdue_analysis  
WHEN CURRENT_DATE - la.end_date::DATE <= 30 THEN 'OVERDUE_1_30' -- Adjust buckets
```

### Date Ranges
Adjust date ranges for analysis views:
```sql
-- Change analysis periods as needed
WHERE th.trans_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days' -- Adjust period
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **View dependencies**: Deploy views in the correct order (01, 02, 03, 04, 05)
2. **Missing tables**: Ensure base tables exist before creating views
3. **Performance**: Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE to check query performance
4. **Data types**: Verify date/numeric field casting works with your data

### Debug Queries
```sql
-- Check view definition
\d+ view_name

-- Test view performance
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM view_name LIMIT 100;

-- Check for missing data
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM view_name WHERE field IS NULL;
```

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy views** in order using the provided files
2. **Test queries** with your actual data
3. **Create materialized views** for frequently accessed reports
4. **Set up refresh schedules** for materialized views
5. **Integrate with your application** API layer
6. **Create additional custom views** as needed

These views provide a comprehensive foundation for microfinance reporting and analysis while maintaining good performance and following PostgreSQL best practices.
