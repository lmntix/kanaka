## Accounting Entry Logic

### Key Principles for Accounting Entries:

1. **Automatic Resolution**:

   - User should not select GL accounts manually
   - Member-specific accounts (savings, loans) selected by choosing the member

2. **Double-Entry Enforcement**:
   - Total debits must equal total credits
   - Each transaction should have at least one debit and one credit entry

3. **Multi-level Entries**:
   - Complex transactions may involve multiple account entries
   - E.g., Loan repayment with principal, interest, and penalty components

4. **Default Accounts**:
   - Cash/Bank account for cash transactions
   - Organization's bank account for bank transfers
   - Member-specific accounts based on member selection

5. **Audit Trail**:
   - Every accounting entry must track:
     - User who created it
     - Timestamp
     - Device/location
     - Reference to original transaction

## Transaction Validation Rules

### Key Validations to Implement:

1. **Balance Checks**:
   - Sufficient balance for withdrawals
   - Maximum balance limits (if applicable)
   - Minimum balance maintenance

2. **Limit Validations**:
   - Transaction amount within user authorization limits
   - Daily/monthly transaction limits

3. **Timing Rules**:
   - Business hours restrictions
   - Month-end/year-end special rules

4. **Product Rules**:
   - Minimum/maximum deposit amounts
   - Loan disbursement validation against approved amount
   - Early withdrawal penalties for deposits

5. **Member Status**:
   - Active membership required for transactions
   - KYC completion validation
   - Dormant account reactivation rules

## Reporting Requirements

### Key Reports Related to Transactions:

1. **Daily Transaction Report**:
   - All transactions grouped by type
   - Total cash in/out
   - User-wise transaction summary

2. **Account Statements**:
   - Member-specific transaction history
   - Opening/closing balances
   - Interest accruals

3. **GL Reports**:
   - Account-wise transactions
   - Trial balance
   - Profit & loss statement

4. **Exception Reports**:
   - Failed transactions
   - Transactions requiring approval
   - Unusual transaction patterns

## Implementation Recommendations

1. **Phased Approach**:
   - Implement basic transaction types first (savings, FD, loans)
   - Add complex scenarios in later phases

2. **Configurable Rules Engine**:
   - Allow organizations to define their own validation rules
   - Configure approval workflows without code changes

3. **Training Material**:
   - Create transaction-specific training guides
   - Include sample scenarios and test cases

4. **Audit Requirements**:
   - Ensure all transactions are traceable and auditable
   - Maintain complete history of accounting entries

5. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Optimize for high transaction volume
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed data
   - Consider batch processing for interest calculations
