## üîÑ Interest Posting System - Complete Guide

### Overview of Interest Posting Tables

Your microfinance app has **four specialized interest posting tables**, each handling interest calculations and postings for different account types:

| Table                         | Purpose                         | Records | Transaction Flow    |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------- |
| **`loan_interest_post`**      | Loan interest accrual & posting | 148,953 | Asset ‚Üí Income      |
| **`saving_interest_post`**    | Savings interest payment        | 221     | Expense ‚Üí Liability |
| **`fd_interest_post`**        | Fixed deposit interest          | 556     | Expense ‚Üí Liability |
| **`recurring_interest_post`** | Recurring deposit interest      | 18,716  | Expense ‚Üí Liability |

### Table Structure (Common Fields)

Each interest posting table follows the same structure:

```sql
-- Common structure for all *_interest_post tables
{
  "[product]_interest_post_id": "Primary key",
  "sub_accounts_id": "Links to specific member account",
  "transaction_head_id": "Links to actual GL transaction",
  "amount": "Interest amount calculated/posted",
  "int_date": "Interest calculation/posting date",
  "rate": "Interest rate applied",
  "posting": "Status code (1=Posted, 2=Calculated, etc.)",
  "changed_manually": "Manual override flag (0/1)"
}
```

### Interest Posting Workflow

#### **1. Loan Interest Posting (`loan_interest_post`)**

**Purpose**: Charges interest on outstanding loans

**Accounting Entry**:

```sql
-- Example: ‚Çπ20 interest on loan account 4088
Dr. Member Loan Interest Receivable (A/c 223)  ‚Çπ20.00
    Cr. Weekly Loan Principal (A/c 222)       ‚Çπ20.00
```

**Data Flow**:

```sql
-- Step 1: Calculate interest
INSERT INTO loan_interest_post (
  sub_accounts_id, amount, int_date, rate, posting
) VALUES (
  4088, 20.0000, '2015-04-05', 15.0, '2'  -- Status: Calculated
);

-- Step 2: Create GL transaction
INSERT INTO transaction_head (
  trans_amount, trans_narration, trans_date
) VALUES (
  20.0000, 'Interest upto 05.04.2015', '05/04/2015'
);

-- Step 3: Post double-entry
INSERT INTO transaction_details VALUES
  (transaction_head_id, 223, 4088, 20.0000),    -- Dr. Interest Receivable
  (transaction_head_id, 222, 4088, -20.0000);   -- Cr. Loan Principal

-- Step 4: Update posting status
UPDATE loan_interest_post
SET posting = '1', transaction_head_id = [new_id]
WHERE loan_interest_post_id = [record_id];
```

**Key Points**:

- **High volume**: 148,953 records (most active)
- **Rate example**: 15% annual rate
- **Increases** loan receivable (asset)
- **Reduces** loan principal (asset)

#### **2. Savings Interest Posting (`saving_interest_post`)**

**Purpose**: Credits interest to member savings accounts

**Accounting Entry**:

```sql
-- Example: ‚Çπ40 interest credit to savings
Dr. Interest Expense (A/c XXX)           ‚Çπ40.00
    Cr. Member Savings Account (A/c 64)      ‚Çπ40.00
```

**Data Flow**:

```sql
-- Interest posting for savings
INSERT INTO saving_interest_post (
  sub_accounts_id, amount, int_date, rate, posting
) VALUES (
  3893, 40.0000, '2016-03-31', 4.0, '1'  -- Status: Posted
);
```

**Key Points**:

- **Low volume**: 221 records
- **Rate example**: 4% annual rate
- **Creates expense** for the institution
- **Increases member savings** balance

#### **3. Fixed Deposit Interest Posting (`fd_interest_post`)**

**Purpose**: Credits interest on FD accounts

**Accounting Entry**:

```sql
-- Example: ‚Çπ13,629 FD interest
Dr. Interest Expense (A/c XXX)           ‚Çπ13,629.00
    Cr. Member FD Account (A/c 25)           ‚Çπ13,629.00
```

**Data Flow**:

```sql
-- FD interest posting
INSERT INTO fd_interest_post (
  sub_accounts_id, amount, int_date, rate, posting
) VALUES (
  1812, 13629.0000, '2016-03-31', 11.5, '1'
);
```

**Key Points**:

- **Medium volume**: 556 records
- **Highest rates**: 11.5% (attractive FD rates)
- **Large amounts**: Up to ‚Çπ13,629 per posting
- **Automatic posting** (`changed_manually = 0`)

#### **4. Recurring Deposit Interest Posting (`recurring_interest_post`)**

**Purpose**: Credits interest on RD accounts

**Accounting Entry**:

```sql
-- Example: RD interest credit
Dr. Interest Expense (A/c XXX)           ‚ÇπAmount
    Cr. Member RD Account (A/c XXX)          ‚ÇπAmount
```

**Data Flow**:

```sql
-- RD interest posting
INSERT INTO recurring_interest_post (
  sub_accounts_id, amount, int_date, rate, posting
) VALUES (
  1774, 0.0000, '2015-03-31', 10.0, '2'
);
```

**Key Points**:

- **High volume**: 18,716 records
- **Rate example**: 10% annual rate
- **Status '2'**: Different posting logic
- **Monthly processing**: Regular interval postings

### Interest Posting Status Codes

| Status Code | Meaning        | Action                                     |
| ----------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **'1'**     | **Posted**     | Interest posted to GL, transaction created |
| **'2'**     | **Calculated** | Interest calculated but not yet posted     |
| **'3'**     | **Pending**    | Awaiting approval/processing               |
| **'4'**     | **Adjustment** | Manual adjustment or correction            |

### Setting Up Interest Posting in Your App

#### **1. Monthly Interest Calculation Job**

```sql
-- Pseudo-code for interest calculation
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION calculate_monthly_interest()
RETURNS void AS $$
BEGIN
  -- Calculate loan interest
  INSERT INTO loan_interest_post (
    sub_accounts_id, amount, int_date, rate, posting
  )
  SELECT
    la.sub_accounts_id,
    (outstanding_balance * interest_rate * days_in_month / 365 / 100),
    CURRENT_DATE,
    ls.interest_rate,
    '2'  -- Calculated status
  FROM loan_accounts la
  JOIN loan_schemes ls ON la.loan_schemes_id = ls.loan_schemes_id
  WHERE la.status = 'ACTIVE';

  -- Similar logic for savings, FD, RD...
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

#### **2. Interest Posting to GL**

```sql
-- Post calculated interest to general ledger
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION post_interest_to_gl()
RETURNS void AS $$
DECLAREipayment_rec RECORD;
BEGIN
  -- Process loan interest postings
  FOR interest_rec IN
    SELECT * FROM loan_interest_post WHERE posting = '2'
  LOOP
    -- Create transaction header
    INSERT INTO transaction_head (
      trans_amount, trans_narration, trans_date, users_id
    ) VALUES (
      interest_rec.amount,
      'Loan Interest - ' || interest_rec.int_date,
      interest_rec.int_date,
      'SYSTEM'
    ) RETURNING transaction_head_id INTO NEW_TRANS_ID;

    -- Create transaction details (double-entry)
    INSERT INTO transaction_details VALUES
      (NEW_TRANS_ID, 223, interest_rec.sub_accounts_id, interest_rec.amount),   -- Dr. Interest Receivable
      (NEW_TRANS_ID, 222, interest_rec.sub_accounts_id, -interest_rec.amount);  -- Cr. Loan Account

    -- Update posting status
    UPDATE loan_interest_post
    SET posting = '1', transaction_head_id = NEW_TRANS_ID
    WHERE loan_interest_post_id = interest_rec.loan_interest_post_id;
  END LOOP;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

#### **3. App Integration Points**

**Daily Operations**:

```javascript
// Frontend: Interest accrual display
const getAccruedInterest = async (memberAccountId) => {
  const result = await query(
    `
    SELECT ai.int_amount as accrued_amount,
           ai.int_date as last_calculation
    FROM accrued_interest ai
    WHERE ai.sub_accounts_id = $1
    ORDER BY ai.int_date DESC LIMIT 1
  `,
    [memberAccountId]
  );

  return result.rows[0];
};
```

**Monthly Processing**:

```javascript
// Backend: Monthly interest posting
const processMonthlyInterest = async (processingDate) => {
  // 1. Calculate interest for all active accounts
  await db.query("SELECT calculate_monthly_interest()");

  // 2. Generate approval report
  const pendingInterest = await db.query(`
    SELECT * FROM loan_interest_post WHERE posting = '2'
  `);

  // 3. After approval, post to GL
  await db.query("SELECT post_interest_to_gl()");

  // 4. Update member balances
  await updateMemberBalances();
};
```

### Best Practices for Implementation
